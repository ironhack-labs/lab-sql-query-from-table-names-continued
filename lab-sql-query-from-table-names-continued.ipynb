    "## SQL Prompt Engineering Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This report analyzes three different approaches to prompting GPT-3.5 for SQL query generation, examining their effectiveness and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Variations Tested\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Story-based Context Approach\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Provided clear real-world context\n",
    "- Included detailed comments explaining data structure\n",
    "- Made queries more intuitive through business context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Sometimes generated overly complex queries\n",
    "- Could occasionally include unnecessary business logic\n",
    "- Extra context sometimes led to verbose responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Pattern-Matching Approach\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Very consistent query structure\n",
    "- Excellent at handling common query patterns\n",
    "- Reduced hallucination by focusing on specific patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Less flexible with unusual queries\n",
    "- Sometimes missed nuanced requirements\n",
    "- Could be too rigid in query construction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Educational Approach\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Provided clear explanations of SQL concepts\n",
    "- Good at handling complex queries\n",
    "- Helped understand query logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Sometimes included unnecessary explanations\n",
    "- Could be slower in response\n",
    "- Occasional over-complication of simple queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hallucination Cases\n",
    "1. Table names occasionally mixed up in complex joins\n",
    "2. Column names sometimes invented when not explicitly defined\n",
    "3. Functions assumed to exist in SQLite that don't\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices Learned\n",
    "1. Always include sample data in the prompt\n",
    "2. Explicitly define table relationships\n",
    "3. Use consistent naming conventions\n",
    "4. Include a few example queries for pattern learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Effective Approach\n",
    "The Pattern-Matching approach proved most reliable for consistent query generation, especially when combined with clear table definitions and sample data. This approach:\n",
    "- Reduced hallucinations\n",
    "- Produced more consistent results\n",
    "- Generated more efficient queries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "1. Clear structure and relationships in prompts are crucial\n",
    "2. Less context is sometimes better than too much\n",
    "3. Example queries significantly improve accuracy\n",
    "4. Explicit pattern matching reduces hallucination\n",
    "5. Sample data helps ground the model's responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "1. Use Pattern-Matching approach as base\n",
    "2. Include minimal but essential context\n",
    "3. Always provide table relationships\n",
    "4. Include 2-3 example queries\n",
    "5. Add sample data for complex schemas"
