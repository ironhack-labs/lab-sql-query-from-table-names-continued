    "# Report on SQL Prompt Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we explored different prompt variations to generate SQL queries using the OpenAI API. We compared the performance of the old prompt and the new prompt, which was designed based on the guidelines from the Ohio University paper on prompting LLMs for Text-to-SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations That Didn't Work Well\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Old Prompt**: The old prompt often resulted in SQL queries that were either incorrect or overly complex. For example, when asked \"What teams, team id 1\", the generated SQL was not always accurate and sometimes included unnecessary joins or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **New Prompt**: The new prompt, while generally more accurate, still had instances where the generated SQL was not entirely correct. For example, when asked \"What players are playing in the team with ID 1?\", the SQL generated sometimes missed the necessary joins between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hallucinations\n",
    "\n",
    "There were instances where GPT-3.5-turbo hallucinated, generating SQL queries with non-existent table names or fields. This was more prevalent with the old prompt, which lacked the structured format and examples provided in the new prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Prompts**: Providing a structured prompt with clear table definitions and example queries significantly improves the accuracy of the generated SQL. The new prompt, which included table structures and few-shot examples, outperformed the old prompt in generating correct SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot Learning**: Including few-shot examples in the prompt helps guide the model to generate more accurate SQL queries. This technique proved effective in reducing hallucinations and improving the overall quality of the generated SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prompt Design**: The design of the prompt plays a crucial role in the performance of the model. A well-designed prompt with clear instructions and examples can significantly enhance the model's ability to generate correct and efficient SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the new prompt designed based on the Ohio University paper's guidelines showed better performance in generating accurate SQL queries compared to the old prompt. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in handling complex queries and reducing hallucinations. Future work could focus on further refining the prompt design and exploring additional techniques to enhance the model's performance."
