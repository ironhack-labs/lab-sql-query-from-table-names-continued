    "Importance of Clear Prompts: Structured and explicit prompts play a critical role in guiding the model to provide accurate and relevant responses.\n",
    "Model Strengths: GPT excels at mapping user queries to table descriptions when the context is well-defined, demonstrating its ability to process structured information effectively.\n",
    "Limitations of General Models: GPT struggles to generate actionable outputs for complex tasks, such as writing detailed SQL queries or inferring relationships across tables without additional guidance.\n",
