    "REPORT\n",
    "\n",
    "We transitioned from a generic “employees” and “studies” dataset to a context focused on footballers, tracking their goals and performance metrics. This shift was driven by the need to create more relatable and domain-specific SQL queries. The new prompt structure included few-shot examples, which have been shown to guide the model toward more accurate outputs by providing context and samples of expected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tClear Table Definitions: Using precise table structures for footballers (including fields such as goals, average goals per match, team, and field position) helped the model better understand the relationships within the data, leading to more relevant SQL query generation.\n",
    "2.\tFew-Shot Learning: Including example queries in the prompt significantly improved the quality of the responses. This technique guided the model to formulate SQL queries that were both correct and efficient.\n",
    "3.\tError Reduction: Compared to the old prompt, where the model occasionally produced incorrect queries, the updated method resulted in more consistent accuracy. The use of SQL syntax examples directly in the prompt reduced ambiguities, leading to fewer misunderstandings by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variations that Didn’t Work Well\n",
    "\n",
    "During the process, a few variations were noted where the model struggled or produced incorrect results:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAmbiguous Natural Language Requests: When the query was phrased in a less specific manner, the model occasionally generated SQL that did not fully address the question or misunderstood the intent. For example, vague questions like “What is the best player?” sometimes led to incomplete or irrelevant SQL statements.\n",
    "•\tComplex Queries with Multiple Conditions: Queries requiring multiple JOIN operations or nested subqueries were sometimes mishandled. In these cases, the model either omitted key conditions or misinterpreted the relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hallucinations and Inaccuracies\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tIncorrect Table References: In a few instances, the model attempted to reference table names or columns that were not part of the defined schema. This “hallucination” issue was significantly reduced with the improved prompt but still occurred in cases of ambiguous or loosely defined user input.\n",
    "•\tOrder of Operations in SQL: Occasionally, the model generated SQL code with a less optimal order of conditions, leading to inefficiencies. While this did not make the SQL syntactically incorrect, it did reduce its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tImportance of Context and Examples: Providing a detailed prompt with a clear context and few-shot examples greatly enhances the performance of models like GPT in text-to-SQL tasks. It not only guides the model but also sets a standard for how to approach similar problems.\n",
    "2.\tNeed for Domain-Specific Prompts: Tailoring the prompt to a specific domain, such as football in this case, helps the model generate more relevant SQL queries. This approach ensures that the generated queries align more closely with the domain’s typical data structures and use cases.\n",
    "3.\tIterative Refinement: Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Continuous refinement and testing with real-world scenarios are essential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the generated SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The shift to a domain-specific dataset, combined with few-shot learning, has resulted in more precise and contextually relevant SQL queries. The updated prompt method provides a robust foundation for future text-to-SQL tasks, although there is still room for improvement in handling more complex queries and ambiguous user inputs."
